RF Educational tool from here https://github.com/cifertech/RF-Clown
I made some chnage to enable the sketch to compile with ver 1.8.19 of the Arduino IDE.

PCB Gerbers are also complete now and ready for your PCB Manaufature of choice.

Please see the orginal project as this repositry is just to resolve the issues i had when trying to get the project working.
