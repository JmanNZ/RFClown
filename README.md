# RFClown
RF Educational tool from here https://github.com/cifertech/RF-Clown
I made some chnage to enable the sketch to compile with ver 1.8.19 of the Arduino IDE.

PCB Gerbers are also complete now and ready for your PCB Manaufature of choice.

Please see the orginal project as this repositry is just to resolve the issues i had when trying to get the project working.

Instead of using a raw OLED display do not fit all the components under the OLED and use a OLED Module.
I glued four plastic stand off to the PCB and attached the OLED with screws to the stand offs.
OLED Module is connected to the PCB with 4 short wires under the module.
